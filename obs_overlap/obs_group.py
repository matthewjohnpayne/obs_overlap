The classes in "obs_group" focus on the functions needed to
operate on an ObsGroup to decide which of the constituent
observations will be assigned "credit" and "selected" status.

    https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hLUi-E4SOTWOLUEIUpcHVHJVSV4eIGUz5Uyb0OdQ8ok/edit?usp=sharing

    CREDIT
    == Earliest
    
    PRIMARY
    Do not select observations as primary that have been explicitly replaced/remeasured by other observations.
    Do not select observations as primary that have been labelled as "deleted", or some similar term.
    Iterate through remaining selectable observations:
        (i) Start with any selectable observations with the same submitting "actor" as CREDIT observation :
        Irrespective of exact -vs- near-duplicate: take latest as selected.
        I.e. if the SAME person has re-submitted, then even if it is not marked as an explicit remeasure, treat it as taking priority over the earlier submission by the same person.
        This allows us to gracefully deal with situations like C51 resubmissions-and-extension.
        
        (ii) For any other "implicit remeasures" from "actors" other than the CREDIT actor
        only assign priority IF the implicit remeasure meets explicit CRITERIA defining significant superiority over the observation selected in (i).
        Criteria might include â€¦
                The later submission uses a superior stellar catalog (e.g. GAIA-2)
                The later submission is from a preferred/expert person/source
                Some kind of manual MPC override
    
    (NB) Yet more complex criteria may be necessary at a later date
