The classes in "obs_group" focus on the functions needed to
operate on an ObsGroup to decide which of the constituent
observations will be assigned "credit" and "selected" status.

    Do not select observations that have been explicitly replaced/remeasured by other observations.
    Do not select observations that have been labelled as "deleted", or some similar term.
    If exact duplicate (including submitting org/person/program ) : take latest as selected.
    If near-duplicates:
        Assume that "implicit remeasures" take priority. I.e. if the SAME person has re-submitted a near- (but not exact-) dup, then even if it is not marked as an explicit remeasure, treat it as taking priority over the earlier submission by the same person.
        If from a different person, then DEFAULT to taking the earlier observation (i.e. from the original discoverer) UNLESS the later observation meets explicit CRITERIA defining significant superiority. Criteria might include â€¦
                The later submission uses a superior stellar catalog (e.g. GAIA-2)
                The later submission is from a preferred/expert person/source
                Some kind of manual MPC override
    
    Yet more complex criteria may be necessary at a later date
